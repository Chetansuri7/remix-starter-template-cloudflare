## üí° Design & Content Strategy (Highlights)

- Lean on theme for colors/typography but use gradients, glow-shadows, and bento styling where possible for visual pop.
- Fast, clean, legible. Use modern type and spacing (Figtree, clamp(), robust vertical rhythm).
- Subtle depth: Use shadows, radii, gradients for buttons/sections/cards.
- Animate where possible: logo marquees, hero media, feature cards/tabs, testimonial slider.
- Mobile-first strategy: collapsible nav, stacked layouts, accessible tab orders.
- Use clear trust signals: security badges, testimonials, partner logos, and transparency in pricing/benefits.
- Hosted media: Place any bespoke demo videos or major assets into `/public` for easy referencing.

## üìù Next Steps
